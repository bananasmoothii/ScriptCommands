# ScriptCommands
ScriptCommands is a Minecraft plugin that allows you to make commands very easily using scripts. You can do a lot using the scripts, even replace plugins. Just read the wiki !

Note: this plugin is not usable for now, lots of things are missing. A first buggy beta will probably be released around January 2021.
