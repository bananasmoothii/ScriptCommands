# ScriptCommands
ScriptCommands is a Minecraft plugin that allows you to make commands very easily using scripts. You can do a lot using the scripts, even replace plugins. Just read the wiki !

Note: this plugin is not usable for now, lots of things are missing. ~~A first buggy beta will probably be released around January 2022.~~ This project is more or less abandonned as it isn't very useful and I'm working on other things like [Snow Wars](https://github.com/bananasmoothii/SnowWars) and BananaRadio (private repo sorry)

**Warning:** I (@bananasmoothii) am not a native English speaker, so if you find typos or things that could be written better
(especially in texts/strings, and even more especially for things that I thought it would be cool/funny to write the way
I wrote it), please feel free to send me a message, or if you are motivated you can even open a pull request !
