# How to compile

First, you need the [JDK for Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html). You can check if everything needed is here with the command line `mvn --version`.

Then, run `mvn package`, and you will get your jar file in the `target` directory.

That's it !
